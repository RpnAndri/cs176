We made a filter that changes depending on how many fingers you are raising up.
Each filter number corresponds to the number of fingers to be raised.
Filter 1 - Resizes image to half its dimensions
Filter 2 - Rotate image to 180 degrees
Filter 3 - Gaussian Blur
Filter 4 - BGR (not rgb)
Filter 5 - Black and White

We used opencv, tkinter (User Interface), tkmacosx (tkinter design for macos users), and mediapipe (hand detection)
We read up on mediapipe to learn how to use it in detecting hands.

The code is documented on how fingers are considered raised.

The code/algorithm for the fingers raised is not perfect as it is exploitable.

You can try, and make sure to download the appropriate libraries indicated in requirements.txt.

Hand detection was learned from these documentations using mediapipe.
